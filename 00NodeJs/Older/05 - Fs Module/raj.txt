Hi, I'm Jonas! I'm one of Udemy's Top Instructors and all my premium courses have earned the best-selling status for outstanding performance and student satisfaction.

I'm a full-stack web developer and designer with a passion for building beautiful web interfaces from scratch. I've been building websites and apps since 2010 and also have a Master's degree in Engineering.

I discovered my passion for teaching and helping others by sharing everything I knew during college. This passion led me to Udemy in 2015, where I now have the privilege of training 2,000,000+ learners in the field of web development.

What learners love the most about all my courses is the fact that I take the time to explain every single concept in a way that everyone can easily understand.
